# Rust Bubble Sort

This is a Rust implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Requirements

To run this program, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system.

## Usage

To run the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
cargo run
The program will prompt you to enter a list of integers, separated by spaces. Once you've entered the list, the program will sort it using the bubble sort algorithm and print the sorted list to the console.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling rust-bubble-sort v0.1.0 (/path/to/project)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.44s
     Running `target/debug/rust-bubble-sort`
Please enter a list of integers separated by spaces:
5 2 7 3 9
Sorted array: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
